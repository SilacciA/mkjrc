# mkjrc
A smart program to create JR project content
## What's JR man ?
What ?! You don't know JR ?! How can you not know it ! Google it as you'd do for your ingame problems and instruct yourself :3
## How to use
Well this repo does not only contain a little helper for the project, but is mainly designed for a concurrent programming course
I have in my class. Project are CVS (the steampunk version of versioning) compatible, that's why you should be careful when using it,
especially when creating a new project. We have a hard but very sympathic teacher that impose us the 10 commandements of coding
(but they are made of good practices to follow even if you don't have the same teacher), so one of the utility is dedicated to this.
### Tools
As I can't remember the exact work I've done this last months, I assume that you can read some code (careful its far from poetry).
Here are the tools and their purpose:

* stcvsp : used to start a new cvs project with the name given in first parameter.
* mkjrc  : main utility to create JR classes/monitors/handlers (uses the templates folder).
* c10mds : the 10 commandements checker.

## State of the project
This project is far from a finished state especially for the c10mds script. But everything is on its way will be, one day I wish, finished.
The scripts are all usable as I use them to simplify my terrible life a exploited student.
